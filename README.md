This project seeks to publicize the richness of popular Colombian music, through the study of 180 musical pieces belonging to six of the best-known Colombian musical genres: Bambuco, Carranga, Cumbia, Joropo, Pasillo, Vallenato. The study of these genres is considered through the analysis of the content of songs by means of natural language processing techniques and machine learning.
